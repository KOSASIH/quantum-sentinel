# Overview of Security Frameworks and Standards

## Overview
This document provides an overview of various security frameworks and standards that can be applied to the Quantum Sentinel framework. These frameworks help organizations establish and maintain effective security practices.

## 1. Common Security Frameworks

### 1.1 NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **Overview**: A voluntary framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.
- **Core Functions**:
  - **Identify**: Understand the organizationâ€™s environment to manage cybersecurity risk.
  - **Protect**: Implement safeguards to limit the impact of potential cybersecurity events.
  - **Detect**: Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
  - **Respond**: Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
  - **Recover**: Maintain plans for resilience and restore any capabilities or services that were impaired.

### 1.2 ISO/IEC 27001
- **Overview**: An international standard for information security management systems (ISMS) that provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information.
- **Key Components**:
  - Establishing an ISMS.
  - Risk assessment and treatment.
  - Continuous improvement of the ISMS.

### 1.3 CIS Controls
- **Overview**: A set of best practices developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) to help organizations improve their cybersecurity posture.
- **Key Controls**:
  - Inventory and control of hardware assets.
  - Continuous vulnerability management.
  - Controlled use of administrative privileges.

## 2. Compliance Standards

### 2.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- **Overview**: A regulation in the European Union that governs data protection and privacy for individuals.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Data protection by design and by default.
  - Rights of individuals regarding their personal data.

### 2.2 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- **Overview**: A U.S. regulation that protects sensitive patient health information.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI).
  - Regular risk assessments and employee training.

### 2.3 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- **Overview**: A set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.
  - Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.

## 3. Cloud Security Standards

### 3.1 Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (STAR)
- **Overview**: A program that documents the security controls provided by various cloud computing offerings.
- **Key Components**:
  - Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ).
  - Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM).

### 3.2 FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)
- **Overview**: A U.S. government program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.
- **Key Components**:
  - Security Assessment Report (SAR).
  - Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M).

## Conclusion
Implementing a security framework or standard is essential for maintaining a robust security posture within the Quantum Sentinel framework. Regular reviews and updates will help ensure compliance with evolving regulations and best practices.
