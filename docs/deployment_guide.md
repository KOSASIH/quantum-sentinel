# Deployment Guide

## Overview
This document provides instructions for deploying the Quantum Sentinel framework in a production environment.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have the following installed:
  - Python 3.x
  - pip (Python package installer)
  - A supported database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the Quantum Sentinel repository to your server:

```bash
1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/quantum-sentinel.git
2 cd quantum-sentinel
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

```bash
1 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables:

```
1 API_KEY=your_api_key
2 DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

## Step 4: Database Setup
1. Create the database using your preferred database management tool.
2. Run the database migrations (if applicable):

```bash
1 python src/manage.py migrate
```

## Step 5: Start the Application
To start the application, run:

```bash
1 python src/main.py
```

## Step 6: Access the Application
Once the application is running, you can access it via the configured API endpoints.

## Additional Considerations

1. **Security**: Ensure that your server is secured and that sensitive information is not exposed.
2. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring tools to keep track of application performance and health.
3. **Backup**: Implement a backup strategy for your database and application data.

## Conclusion
Following these steps will help you successfully deploy the Quantum Sentinel framework in a production environment.
