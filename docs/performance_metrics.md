# Metrics for Evaluating System Performance

## Overview
This document outlines the key performance metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Quantum Sentinel framework.

## 1. Response Time
- **Definition**: The time taken for the system to respond to a user request.
- **Importance**: A critical metric for user experience; lower response times lead to higher user satisfaction.
- **Target**: Response time should be under 200 milliseconds for API calls.

## 2. Throughput
- **Definition**: The number of requests processed by the system in a given time period.
- **Importance**: Indicates the system's capacity to handle concurrent users and requests.
- **Target**: Aim for a throughput of at least 1000 requests per second.

## 3. Error Rate
- **Definition**: The percentage of requests that result in errors.
- **Importance**: A high error rate can indicate underlying issues in the system.
- **Target**: Maintain an error rate of less than 1%.

## 4. Resource Utilization
- **Definition**: The percentage of system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) being used.
- **Importance**: Helps identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.
- **Target**: Keep CPU utilization below 70% and memory usage below 80%.

## 5. Latency
- **Definition**: The delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction.
- **Importance**: Lower latency improves the overall responsiveness of the system.
- **Target**: Aim for latency under 100 milliseconds.

## 6. User Satisfaction
- **Definition**: A qualitative measure of user experience and satisfaction with the system.
- **Importance**: Directly impacts user retention and engagement.
- **Target**: Conduct regular user surveys to maintain a satisfaction score of 90% or higher.

## Conclusion
Monitoring these performance metrics is essential for ensuring the Quantum Sentinel framework operates efficiently and meets user expectations.
